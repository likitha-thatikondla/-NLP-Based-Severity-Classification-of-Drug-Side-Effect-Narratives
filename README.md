# NLP-Based Drug Side-Effect Narrative Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a small NLP-based project that works with patient-reported drug side-effect narratives.  
The goal is to explore text preprocessing, basic modeling, and decision logic on healthcare-related textual data.

This project is primarily intended for **learning and practice**, and to maintain an active GitHub profile.

---

## Contents
The repository includes the following components:

- Jupyter notebooks for:
  - Building drug-related text profiles
  - Training a severity classification model
  - Applying a simple decision logic on model outputs
- Dataset files used for experimentation
- Saved model artifacts (where applicable)

---

## Notebooks
- `01_build_drug_profiles.ipynb`  
  Text preprocessing and construction of drug-side-effect profiles.

- `02_severity_model.ipynb`  
  Feature extraction and training of a machine learning model to classify severity.

- `03_decision_engine.ipynb`  
  Rule-based or logic-driven interpretation of model predictions.

---

## Objective
To gain hands-on exposure to:
- Natural Language Processing workflows
- Text cleaning and feature extraction
- Basic machine learning model training
- Applying simple decision logic on NLP outputs

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK / basic NLP utilities  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Notes
- This is a learning-oriented project and not a production-ready system.
- The structure and content may be improved or refactored in future iterations.
