# NLP-Based Drug Side-Effect Narrative Classification

## Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing techniques to classify drug side-effect narratives based on severity and type.

## Problem Statement
Patient-reported drug side effects are often unstructured and difficult to analyze. Automating their classification can assist healthcare analytics and pharmacovigilance.

## Dataset
Drug side-effect narrative dataset containing patient-reported text descriptions and corresponding labels.

## Approach
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Tokenization and lemmatization
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Machine learning classification models
- Performance evaluation using standard metrics

## Results
Model performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run notebooks in order from `01` to `05`
